# Draft Translations

These locale files are **not actively maintained** and may be missing keys or
contain outdated strings compared to the primary `en.json` locale.

They are kept here as a starting point for future translation work. To activate
a translation, bring its file up to date with `en.json` (ensure all keys are
present and correctly translated), then move it back into the parent `locales/`
directory. The launcher auto-discovers any `.json` file in `locales/`.
